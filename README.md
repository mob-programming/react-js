# March Mob Programming Workshop Challenge

Using React, create a click counter with a button and display of click tally.

- When the button is clicked, the counter tally increments by one

If that's too easy, add a reset button.

- When the reset button is clicked, the counter tally resets to zero

## Methodology
Use TDD with Jest and React-testing-library.
